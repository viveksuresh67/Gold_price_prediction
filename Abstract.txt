Gold prices fluctuate a lot based on many factors, such as, interest rates, USD, inflation, central bank decisions, other asset class movements, etc. Traders for a long time have been using traditional research and analysis to profit from these fluctuations. Accurately predicting the next closing price of Gold can be a bit challenging, considering the non-linearity and volatility of this commodity.
The aim of this research is to find out if with the advancements in machine learning and computing:
 •	Can new methods be used for better decision-making? 
     	A combination of Pattern mining, Time-series and Causality must be used to find an answer for this question. 
 •	Is it possible to create an algorithm based on historic data to predict gold price movements? 
     	This will be done using Predictive Analytics and Modeling.
 •	Has the introduction of cryptocurrencies changed the correlation of gold price and interest rates?
     	Time series and Causality.
 •	Also, is there a correlation between cryptocurrencies and gold price?
     	Time series and Causality.

The Data that will be used for this research are the following:
 •	Daily Gold price from 1978 to 2021 
     	https://www.kaggle.com/odins0n/monthly-gold-prices
 •	Daily US Federal interest rate from 1954 to 2022

 •	Daily Bitcoin price in USD from 2014 to 2021
     	https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart
The timeframe on these databases are different, but the data required for this research are the gold prices and the interest rates which we have for the same time period.
